    "This project aims to explore the opportunities offered by the development of an electric traction chain for a light commercial vehicle dedicated to carry out last mile delivery logistics in city centers. Last miles deliveries vehicles will go electric in the next future, this is part of most authorities willing to limit emissions as E-Commerce is growing. We have chosen to base the project on an electric version of the widely spread  [Daily IVECO Van Euro 6](https://www.iveco.com/DailyBusiness/img/doc/BTS_L1612301MASTER_05-16.pdf). The geometrical characteristics are kept but the electric version is assumed to be 1000kg heavier. \n",
